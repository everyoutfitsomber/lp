        </header>
        <section class="modal-content">
          <p><strong>What is a bezel?</strong></p>
          <p>It's the small ring of metal surrounding the outside of a gemstone. It holds the gemstone in place.</p>
          <p><strong>Why do we love bezels?</strong></p> 
          <p>We love bezels for their minimalism and their symmetry. They are our favorite way to set a gemstone.</p>
          <p><strong>What's the challenge with bezels?</strong></p>
          <p>Most jewelry is cast via molten metal. The cylindrical wall of a bezel setting has to be thick enough for the molten metal to flow into.</p>
          <p>This means that, owing to the process by which they are made, the bezels on small stud earrings have always looked a bit "chunky".</p>
          <p>Worse, it means there is less space for a gemstone. A smaller gemstone has to be used, leading to a more lucklustre sparkle.</p>
          <p><strong>How did we solve this?</strong></p>
          <p>We've championed a special process that allows us to create ultra-thin bezels.</p>
          <p>It took us 7 months.</p>
          <p>But it was worth it.</p>
          <p>It means that (1) less of the bezel overlaps the stone, and (2) we can use a larger gemstone than anybody else for the same-size earring.</p>
          <p>It's a trade secret of ours, and we're yet to find another jewelry brand who does what we do.</p>
          <p>It means that we have an unfair advantage in sparkle.</p>
          <p><strong>For you, it means endless "They're so small and sparkly!" compliments.</strong></p>

          <p>Made for the most sensitive ears for all-day wear.</p>
          <p style="padding-top: 15px;"><strong>1. The metal we use is special</strong></p>
          <p>We source a special alloy more-often used in luxury watches than in traditional jewelry.</p> 
          <p>Not only is this alloy ultra-hypollergenic, exceeding the highest EU standards - one of the reasons for its use in Swiss watches -  it stands up perfectly to the special process we use to create our ultra-thin bezels (gold and silver being far too soft).</p>
          <p style="padding-top: 15px;"><strong>2. The gold coating we use is special</strong></p>
          <p>Contrary to what many people think, most nickel sensitivities in jewelry are triggered not by the metal it is made from, but by a thin nickel coating applied just prior to the gold coating process.</p>
          <p>This nickel layer is applied because it helps the final gold coating process, but it causes havoc for any ears with a nickel sensitivity.</p>
          <p>We do not use normal coating methods for this reason.</p>
          <p>We use a much rarer coating process that allows us to eliminate the nickel layer altogether.</p>
          <p style="padding-top: 15px;"><strong>In a nutshell - we hear from customers all the time that our earrings are the only ones they can wear all day long.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Who we are</strong></p>
            <p>We're a tiny team of artisans who work from our cozy Studio at the base of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado.</p>
            <p>Small dainty earrings is our gig. If that's you, you've found your home!</p>
          </div>
          <p><strong>Tiny is mighty</strong></p>
          <p>Being small affords us one special privilege -</p>
          <p>We get to work deeply and purposefully on one design at a time, for as long as it takes.</p>
          <p>There's no pressure on us to build out a vast collection in order to sustain ourselves. Creatively, we find that very liberating.</p>
          <p><strong>The art of craftmanship</strong></p>
          <p>Once we realized that an exceptional small round bezel stud earring was next-to-impossible to come by, we had the luxury of being able to spend 7 months bringing it to life, and in the process learn new and interesting ways of crafting jewelry.</p>
          <p>We love to tinker and draw on other fields for inspiration - for example, we were able to borrow a technique from the luxury Swiss watch world to create our famous leaf-thin bezels.</p>
          <p><strong>100% privately-owned</strong></p>
          <p>We're 100% privately-owned with no outside investors or influences. We get to work on what we want, for as long as we want.</p>
          <p><strong>Tiny footprint</strong></p>
          <p>We're fortunate to be just down the street from the world's leading experts in eco-friendly packaging. In consultation with them we've been able to eliminate all plastic from our packaging, and we have a suspicion that we have the lowest carbon- and eco-footprint of any jewelry company in the United States.</p>
          <p><strong>Shipped from Colorado</strong></p>
          <p>We pack all our jewelry ourselves and ship direct from our Studio here in Colorado.</p>
          <p><strong>Our voice</strong></p>
          <p>We're small, we don't have a marketing department. Any email you receive from us is written in the first-person by our co-founder Annie. You can reply to her any time and she'll write back.</p>
